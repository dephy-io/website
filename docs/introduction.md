# Introduction

## How does DePHY work?

![How the DePHY network works](./assets/how_dephy_works.png)

DePHY is designed for building DePIN projects rapidly.

It provides:

- A decentralized off-chain network providing
- Bi-directional connectivity between the Web3 world(incl. oracles, Solana Programs, EVM contracts) and the physical world.
- Data determinism and verifiability with ZK-Proof.
- Rapid application development experience with composability and compatibility.

## What is the most critical thing about DePin?

### Verifiability

- Soulbound DID for devices
- All messages are orderable in the network.
- All messages must be signed before publishing to the network to ensure its being traceable.
- Trust built on hardware level
- Oracle with ZK technology

### Composability and Compatibility

- Only commonly used technologies such as MQTT, HTTP, and Protobuf are used in the protocol.
- Fully open-source reference designs are provided.
- Arduino support: Take advantage of Arduino’s exuberant development resources.
- Streaming verifiable data with composable components(e.g., oracles, GPU resources, storage providers).

## How does DePHY be Truly Decentralized？

- The DePHY Network uses NoStr as the transfer layer, an open and mature protocol for decentralized messaging.
- Oracles in DePHY are connected to the same network and share the same decentralized messaging protocol with devices.
- Everyone can deploy their Edge Brokers locally to allow Devices to join the network directly with IoT technologies like MQTT.
- We provide hardware reference designs that are fully open-source with commonly used components, and no supplier binding is required to develop hardware to work with DePHY.
